# No Run Hotkey

A RuneLite plugin that lets you temporarily disable **"Walk here"** by holding a hotkey.

Perfect for avoiding yellow clicks when trying to attack NPCs with tricky clickboxes, or when NPCs die just before you click on them.

## Example Use Cases

- **Colosseum**: Prevent yellow clicks on a dead Javelin Colossus or other NPC after dodging a sky javelin or avoiding a solar flare.
- **Inferno**: Avoid yellow clicks on meleers and Zuk healers.
- **ToA**: Stop yellow clicks as the Obelisk is dying during P1 Wardens.
